Remove Data
    You can use the remove() method to remove documents from a collection. The method takes a conditions document that determines 
    the documents to remove.

    Remove All Documents That Match a Condition
        db.restaurants.remove( { "borough": "Manhattan" } )

    justOne
        By default, the remove() method removes all documents that match the remove condition. Use the justOne option to limit the remove operation to only one of the matching documents.
        db.restaurants.remove( { "borough": "Queens" }, { justOne: true } )

    Remove All Documents
        db.restaurants.remove( { } )

    Drop a Collection
        The remove all operation only removes the documents from the collection. The collection itself, as well as any indexes for the
        collection, remain. To remove all documents from a collection, it may be more efficient to drop the entire collection, including the 
        indexes, and then recreate the collection and rebuild the indexes. Use the drop() method to drop a collection, including any indexes.

        db.restaurants.drop()

            Upon successful drop of the collection, the operation returns true.
