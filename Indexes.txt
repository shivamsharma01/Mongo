Indexes 
    Indexes can support the efficient execution of queries. Without indexes, MongoDB must perform a collection scan, 
    i.e. scan every document in a collection, to select those documents that match the query statement. 
    If an appropriate index exists for a query, MongoDB can use the index to limit the number of documents it must inspect.

    Use the createIndex() method to create an index on a collection. Indexes can support the efficient execution of queries. 
    MongoDB automatically creates an index on the _id field upon the creation of a collection.
    
    To create an index on a field or fields, pass to the createIndex() method an index key specification document that lists the 
    fields to index and the index type for each field:

        { <field1>: <type1>, ...}
            For an ascending index type, specify 1 for <type>.
            For a descending index type, specify -1 for <type>.
    
    createIndex() only creates an index if the index does not exist.


    Create a Single-Field Index
        Create an ascending index on the "cuisine" field of the restaurants collection.

            db.restaurants.createIndex( { "cuisine": 1 } )

                The method returns a document with the status of the operation.

                    {
                        "createdCollectionAutomatically" : false,
                        "numIndexesBefore" : 1,
                        "numIndexesAfter" : 2,
                        "ok" : 1
                    }

    Create a compound index
        MongoDB supports compound indexes which are indexes on multiple fields. The order of the fields determine how the index stores its keys. For example, the following operation creates a compound index on the "cuisine" field and the "address.zipcode" field. The index orders its entries first by ascending "cuisine" values, and then, within each "cuisine", by descending "address.zipcode" values.

            db.restaurants.createIndex( { "cuisine": 1, "address.zipcode": -1 } )
            
                The method returns a document with the status of the operation.

                    {
                        "createdCollectionAutomatically" : false,
                        "numIndexesBefore" : 2,
                        "numIndexesAfter" : 3,
                        "ok" : 1
                    }
